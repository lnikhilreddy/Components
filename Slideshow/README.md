Description
--------------

A Custom Slideshow Component with Multiple Tabs , each of them representing a slide.  Some of the highlights are listed below. 


1. The image for the slide is integrated with the pathfield below it. Image can be changed both ways ( using pathfield or the dragdrop of the image into the image component).  
2. The List in the pathfield dialog is sorted alphabetically. 
3. Rich Text Editors can be used in multiple tabs in the dialog. ( Which is not straight forward in EXTJS ) 
4. Rich Text Editor is restricted in features, also that the user can't paste HTML into the RTE.
