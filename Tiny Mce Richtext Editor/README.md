Description
--------------

This component contains the tinymce richtext editor integrated into the CQ EXT JS API. Tiny MCE 3.4.x is used with EXT JS 3.4 .  This will work with CQ 5.5/5.6/5.6.1 as it uses EXT JS 3.4 .  I am not sure at this point of what version of EXT JS is used in CQ 6.0.  There is a definite possibility that Tiny Mce might break if the EXT JS version is updated. At that point, upgraded version of Tiny Mce needs to be used.
